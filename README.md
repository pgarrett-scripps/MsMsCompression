1. **`NoCompression`**: This strategy does not apply any compression to the data. It simply converts the input `mzs` and `intensities` lists into a string representation and returns it. Decompression converts this string back to the original lists.

2. **`MzSingleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityHex`**: Applies delta encoding to the `mzs` list and hex encoding to the `intensities` list. This strategy is useful when there are small differences between consecutive `mz` values and the intensity values can be efficiently represented in hexadecimal format.

3. **`MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityHex`**: Similar to `MzSingleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityHex`, but also encodes the number of leading zeros in the delta-encoded `mzs` list, providing potentially better compression for data with many leading zeros in the delta values.

4. **`MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityGzipUrl`**: Extends `MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityHex` by additionally applying gzip compression to the intensity values, followed by Base64 URL-safe encoding. This is suitable for scenarios where intensity values need to be compressed further and made safe for URL transmission.

5. **`MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipUrl`**: Applies the `MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionIntensityHex` compression method and then further compresses the entire output using gzip and encodes it using Base64 URL-safe encoding for efficient and URL-safe transmission.

6. **`MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipB85`**: Similar to `MzDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipUrl` but uses Base85 encoding instead of Base64, which may offer a more compact representation for certain data types.

7. **`MzIntensitySingleStringDeltaCompression`**: Applies delta encoding to both `mzs` and sorted `intensities` lists, and then encodes the indices used for sorting the intensities. This strategy could be effective when changes between consecutive `mz` and intensity values are small.

8. **`MzIntensityDoubleStringDeltaCompression`**: An extension of `MzIntensitySingleStringDeltaCompression` that also encodes the number of leading zeros in both `mzs` and `intensities` delta-encoded lists, potentially improving compression for data with many leading zeros.

9. **`MzIntensityDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipUrl`**: Applies `MzIntensityDoubleStringDeltaCompression` and then compresses the entire output using gzip followed by Base64 URL-safe encoding.

10. **`MzIntensityDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipB85`**: Similar to `MzIntensityDoubleStringDeltaCompressionGzipUrl` but uses Base85 encoding for potentially more compact URL-safe string representation.

11. **`GzipCompression`**: Serializes the input data and compresses it using gzip, followed by Base85 encoding for a compact binary representation.

12. **`GzipCompressionBase64`**: Similar to `GzipCompression`, but uses Base64 encoding after gzip compression for a URL-safe representation of the compressed data.

13. **`GzipCompressionBase85`**: Similar to `GzipCompression`, but with Base85 encoding for a potentially more compact representation compared to Base64.

14. **`RoundingCompression`**: Rounds `mzs` and `intensities` to specified precision and converts them to a string representation. This can reduce the size of the data by limiting the precision of the floating-point numbers.

15. **`UrlRoundingCompression`**: Similar to `RoundingCompression` but joins the rounded values with a semicolon (`;`) to create a string representation that is more URL-friendly.

Each strategy has its unique approach to compressing and decompressing mass spectrometry data, balancing between compression ratio, data integrity, and URL compatibility. The choice of strategy depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as the need for precision, the nature of the data, and the context in which the compressed data will be used or transmitted.
